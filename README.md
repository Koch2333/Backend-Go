# Roast

A Go backend for my API service.

And powered by Gin.

## Feature

- I'm currently integrating some of the backend functionality of Atom IT Club.
  (Thanks to @Chemio9 for his great contribution to our club)

## Usage

### Start using

Because of the source code is imperfect, I will update it frequently.

Firstly, clone it into your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Koch2333/Backend-Go.git
```

And, run it directly, the Go module will be download automatically.

```bash
go run .
```
