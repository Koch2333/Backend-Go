# Haru

A Go backend for my API service.

And powered by Gin.

## Feature

Obviously, I haven't figured out what features to use.

## Usage

### Start using

Because of the source code is imperfect, I will update it frequently.

Firstly, clone it into your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Koch2333/Backend-Go.git
```

And, run it directly, the Go module will be download automatically.

```bash
go run main.go
```
